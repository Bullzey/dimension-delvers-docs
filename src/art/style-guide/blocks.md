# Blocks
## Textures
- ⚠️ Try limit the shades of different materials to 6 colors or less.

- ⚠️ Use slight hue shifting for the different shades

## Models
- 🛑 The only blocks that should be allowed to have more complex models are block entities, crafting stations and light blocks.

- 🛑 Blocks must fit inside a 16 cube<sup>3</sup> volume, with the exception of conditional animations.

## Animations
- ⚠️ Keep the amount of parts that move all the time within reason.
