## Code Locations
### Mod
The Mod code is located at the [dimension-delvers-mod GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-mod.git).

The intent of the mod is to provide a primary framework for the modpack. In the long term, this should be standalone, but as we start out, we will focus on making the best mod for our own modpack.

### Pack
The Pack code is located at the [dimension-delvers-pack GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Dimension-Delvers/dimension-delvers-pack.git).

The pack will add additional things that around the mod to make it a full modpack.
