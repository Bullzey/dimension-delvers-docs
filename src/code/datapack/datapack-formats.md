# Datapack formats in DD

A lot of Dimension Delvers's content is added through a unique datapack format. Modpack makers can fully customize how specific things look and behave through easy to understand datapacks. Adding the datapack works exactly as it does in vanilla minecraft, so it shouldn't pose too much troubles.

## Datapacks?
New to making a datapack? The [MC wiki's datapack creation page](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Tutorial:Creating_a_data_pack) has you covered. Just imagine the below formats to be in the very same vanilla list and everything will work out just fine.


## Dimension Delvers namespace
The namespace in a datapack works a bit like the mod name. Mods have their own datapacks included with their own namespace. Dimension Delvers' namespace is dimensiondelvers. In this namespace we have added some basic examples that can guide you to create some new unique variations.
