# Should we remove enchanting from the mod?
## Question
Should we remove enchanting from the mod? It is by itself already a heated topic. WotRift will introduce a new modifier system that will make enchanting fairly obsolete.

## Options
### Yes, remove Enchanting completely 
The enchanting table will no longer work and no enchantments can be applied to items. Will affect all vanilla and modded items.

Modded enchants in the pack that are necessary for mod features to work will be reworked into the modifier system.
### Yes, but only remove for WotRift items
The enchanting table will not work for items from the WotRift mod. Vanilla items and items from other mods will still be enchantable, but their enchants will be disabled in the rifts.

*Technical note*: Disabling enchants in the rift is a very complex endeavor and will require a lot of work. This option thus is considered the worst possible option by the dev team.
### No, Enchanting should stay
Enchanting will remain in the mod. Items can still be enchanted as normal. Rifts will be balanced around this, but this will make the modifier system less useful and less impactful, especially when overpowered modded enchants are added.
